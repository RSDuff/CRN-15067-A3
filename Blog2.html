            <h2>Many people die from smoking</h2>
            <p>Tobacco causes more illness and death than any other drug. In Australia, smoking kills around 18,800
                people every year. This is estimated to be about 70 per cent of all deaths from tobacco, alcohol and
                other drugs. Up to two in three people who smoke throughout their lifetime will die from their habit,
                and they will die on average 10 years earlier than people who do not smoke</p>
